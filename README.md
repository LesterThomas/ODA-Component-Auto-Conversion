# ODA-Component-Auto-Conversion

Node scripts (Javascript) to convert ODA components from one version to another. This can be used for mass error-correction as well as upgrading components to the latest version.

It builds on code in the [ODA Component Webhook](https://github.com/tmforum-oda/oda-canvas/tree/master/source/webhooks).
